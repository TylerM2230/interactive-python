            <div class="sub-interactive-box p-4">
              <p>
                Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a new class (called a <strong>subclass</strong> or <strong>derived class</strong>) to acquire the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of an existing class (called a <strong>superclass</strong> or <strong>base class</strong>). This establishes an "is-a" hierarchical relationship (e.g., a `Dog` is an `Animal`, a `Warrior` is a `Character`). The primary benefit of inheritance is code reusability and the creation of a logical structure. Think of it like a family tree - children inherit traits from their parents but can also have their own unique characteristics.
              </p>
              <p>
                Subclasses can directly use the inherited attributes and methods. They can also add new, specific attributes and methods, or even modify (<strong>override</strong>) inherited methods to provide a more specialized behavior. The <code>super()</code> function is often used within a subclass to call methods of its superclass, especially the <code>__init__()</code> constructor. It's like a child who can use their parent's tools but can also buy new ones or modify the existing ones to better suit their needs.
              </p>
              <pre><code class="language-python"># Superclass (Base Class)
class Character:
  def __init__(self, name, health=100):
    self.name = name
    self.health = health
    print(f"Character '{self.name}' emerges with {self.health} HP.")

  def attack(self, target):
    print(f"{self.name} performs a generic attack on {target.name}.")

  def show_status(self):
    print(f"{self.name} - Health: {self.health}")

# Subclass (Derived Class) - inherits from Character
class Warrior(Character):
  def __init__(self, name, health=150, weapon="Sword"):
    super().__init__(name, health) # Initialize the Character part
    self.weapon = weapon
    print(f"They are a Warrior, wielding a mighty {self.weapon}!")

  # Override the attack method for specialized behavior
  def attack(self, target):
    print(f"{self.name} charges at {target.name} with their {self.weapon}! SWOOSH!")
    # Warriors might do specific damage, etc.

  # Add a new method specific to Warrior
  def use_shield_bash(self, target):
    print(f"{self.name} bashes {target.name} with their shield! THUD!")

# --- Example Usage ---
hero_pixelot = Warrior("Sir Pixelot", 120, "Pixel Blade")
# Output:
# Character 'Sir Pixelot' emerges with 120 HP.
# They are a Warrior, wielding a mighty Pixel Blade!

goblin_grunt = Character("Goblin Grunt", 50)
# Output:
# Character 'Goblin Grunt' emerges with 50 HP.

hero_pixelot.show_status()
# Output: Sir Pixelot - Health: 120

goblin_grunt.show_status()
# Output: Goblin Grunt - Health: 50

hero_pixelot.attack(goblin_grunt) # Calls Warrior's overridden attack method
# Output: Sir Pixelot charges at Goblin Grunt with their Pixel Blade! SWOOSH!

goblin_grunt.attack(hero_pixelot) # Calls Character's generic attack method
# Output: Goblin Grunt performs a generic attack on Sir Pixelot.

hero_pixelot.use_shield_bash(goblin_grunt) # Calls Warrior-specific method
# Output: Sir Pixelot bashes Goblin Grunt with their shield! THUD!</code></pre>

            <h2 class="section-title-8bit">2. Encapsulation: Bundling and Hiding</h2>
            <div class="sub-interactive-box p-4">
              <p>
                Encapsulation is the OOP principle of bundling data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit, i.e., an object. A key aspect of encapsulation is <strong>information hiding</strong>, which means restricting direct access to some of an object's internal state or components. This protects the object's integrity and allows the internal implementation to be changed without affecting external code that uses the object. Think of it like a car's engine - you don't need to know how it works internally to drive the car, and the manufacturer can improve the engine without changing how you use the car.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Python, there isn't true "private" in the sense of some other languages (like Java or C++). Instead, Python uses naming conventions to indicate the intended visibility of attributes and methods:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Single Underscore Prefix (e.g., <code>_attribute</code>):</strong> This is a convention indicating that the attribute or method is intended for internal use within the class or by subclasses. It's a hint to developers not to access it directly from outside the class, but it's still accessible. Like a "Staff Only" door - it's not locked, but you should respect the sign.</li>
                <li><strong>Double Underscore Prefix (e.g., <code>__attribute</code>):</strong> This triggers name mangling. Python changes the name to <code>_ClassName__attribute</code>. This makes it harder to access directly from outside the class, providing a stronger (but still not absolute) form of privacy. It's primarily used to avoid naming conflicts in subclasses. Like a secret compartment in a safe - it's harder to find, but not impossible for someone who knows where to look.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                To provide controlled access to an object's data, public methods (often called getters and setters, or accessor and mutator methods) are typically provided.
              </p>

  def __init__(self, initial_gold=0):

            <div class="sub-interactive-box p-4">
              <p>
                Polymorphism, meaning "many forms," is an OOP concept that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It typically manifests through method overriding, where different subclasses provide their specific implementations of a method defined in their superclass. When you call this method on an object, Python automatically executes the version of the method that is appropriate for the object's actual class. Think of it like a universal remote control - it can operate different types of devices (TV, DVD player, stereo) in their own specific ways, even though you press the same "power" button for all of them.
              </p>
              <p>
                This enables you to write more generic and flexible code. For instance, you can have a list of objects from different subclasses of a common parent and call the same method on each object, with each object responding in its own unique way. Like having a group of musicians - they all know how to play their instruments (common method), but each one plays in their own unique style (specific implementation).
