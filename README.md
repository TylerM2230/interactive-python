# Interactive Guide to Python

A web-based educational platform for learning Python programming through structured lessons and hands-on examples.

## Overview

This project provides 23 interconnected lessons covering Python fundamentals through advanced topics. Each lesson follows a research-based pedagogical approach: concept introduction, mental model building, interactive practice, common pitfalls, and assessment.

## Key Features

- **Pedagogical Structure**: Mental model first approach with physical metaphors
- **Complete Coverage**: 23 lessons from basics to object-oriented programming
- **Interactive Elements**: Code examples, visualizations, and practice exercises
- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for learning on any device
- **8-bit Aesthetic**: Clean design with retro styling using Press Start 2P font

## Running the Project

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No build process or server required.

## Educational Approach

Each lesson follows a structured pattern:
1. **Problem Motivation** - Why the concept exists
2. **Mental Model** - Conceptual foundation with metaphors
3. **Syntax Introduction** - Python implementation
4. **Interactive Practice** - Hands-on exercises
5. **Common Pitfalls** - Error prevention
6. **Assessment** - Knowledge verification

## Design Philosophy

- **Concept before syntax**: Understanding before implementation
- **Mental models**: Physical metaphors for abstract concepts
- **Progressive complexity**: Each lesson builds on previous knowledge
- **Error prevention**: Explicit coverage of common mistakes
- **Mobile-first**: Accessible learning anywhere
